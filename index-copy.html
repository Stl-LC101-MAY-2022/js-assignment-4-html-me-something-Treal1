                    Welcome to my online <b> portfolio </b> and </b> coding journal </b>. I'm happy to share my journey with you! Over the past six years, I've earned a Bachelor and Master degree in Public Health, learned Adobe Illustrator Basics, and reaquainted myself with my love of art. Now I'm working on adding website design to see if programming is my skillset.</p>

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p> During highschool, I had the pleasure of participating in the People to People Student Ambassador Program. I was one of 30 students who traveled to seven European countries: Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. For about a month, I traveled through beautiful cities and was even hosted by a lovely German family for about 4 days. While the conversion rate from the &dollar; to the &euro; and &pound was suprising, it was amazing to be outside of the state of Missouri let alone the United states for the first time in my life. I hope to travel more in the future.</p>

                <h3> Grant Writing Experience</h3>
                <p> My experience with supporting and writing grant proposals has grown exponentially throughout my graduate degree program due to my detailed coursework portfolio, my practicum experience, and my active engagement in the non-profit funding discussions. I have written program plans that focused on access to culturally competent maternal health care for pregnant persons of color, and child lead poisoning prevention through safe demolition promotion in underdeveloped city zip codes. I have built a strong understanding of the components of program planning and implementation that help guide the outline of grant proposals. </p>
                <p> To build upon my foundational coursework, I pursued skill labs like Grant Writing for Foundation Grants, Non-Profit Budget Management, and Government Grants. These short-form courses provided the knowledge and specific skills to prepare a grant proposal, understand trends in foundation giving, and customize a grant proposal to various types of funders with the mission of organizations at the forefront. During my practicum experience, I developed a grant proposal for Washington University’s Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education (CIPE) to acquire $100,000 in funding to expand their student hotspotting program. For this writing process, I scheduled meetings between the center and the St. Louis CHW Coalition (CHWs) to outline the shared goals of the proposal and outline program roles needed to further the joint vision. </p>
                <p> As the main writer of the grant, I coordinated document sharing and continuous feedback regarding the proposal development. The proposal highlighted the pilot of an expanded experiential learning program (hotspotting) that prioritizes CHW competencies for the education of patient-centered care among clinical students. The role of CHWs is emphasized to address the power dynamics of traditional healthcare teams, the influence of academics on the training of clinical students, and the structure of community-facing activities. Funding the incorporation of CHWs meant paying deserving wages for a profession that has roots in Black and Latinx communities, embedded in criminal justice, policy change, and community mobilization. The goal of the proposal was to find funding for CHWs to share their professional and personal experiences with graduate clinical students in a way that supported the long-term commitments to St. Louis City and County communities to promote improved wellbeing and access to resources needed to thrive. This proposal is currently being reviewed by grant foundations and stands as a foundational piece for future opportunities.</p>
                <p> My pursuant of learning experiences extended outside of my degree requirements in the form of participating in guided proposal review panels and speaking with social entrepreneurs on combining grant funding with innovative social impact bonds. While my experience of professionally writing grant proposals is still developing, I am seeking opportunities to better understand the grant landscape and how I can help undervalued communities receive the funds needed to be self-sufficient, innovative, and support their mission of generational flourishing.</p>

                <h2>Where I Am</h2>
                <p> As of May 2022, I am entering a new stage in my life as a young professional with a Master of Public Health from Washington University. After graduating, I realized that I want a career where I can use my interest in using publicaly available data, advocating for under invested communities, and creating aesthetically pleasing, useful applications. </p>

             <section>
                <a name="Future"></a>
                <h2>Where I Hope to Be</h2>
                <p>I have had the pleasure of working in the non-profit sector within my city of St. Louis. Many wonderful organizations provide needed services to the Black community but lack the financial resources needed to create sustainable change. Depending on funding that varies based on the social and political climate can be harmful to the communities in need as well as the agency of non-profit staff. Understanding the nonprofit sector grant application process will be essential for allowing me to help community-led organizations sustain consistent funding in a way that is not cyclically worrisome. Improving my grant writing skills will be an asset as it will help me combine my interest in helping my Black community and increasing the agency of social innovators through access to capital. </p> 
                <p>In the future, I hope to work with social enterprises and non-profits run by groups of individuals with non-traditional leadership or ownership structures, and how they go about finding money in ways that support their mission and align with their values of social justice and community healing. A personal project of mine is an online application that supports the non-profit network in St. Louis and throughout the United States by pairing community health workers (CHWs) within healthcare systems with tools for data collection and collective bargaining power. CHWs are special because they are people from the community that has experienced barriers to healthcare and understand the concerns of marginalized communities. I want to integrate them into the app structure to create a resource tool for health and social service professionals throughout the country. Emphasizing the importance of a historically Black and Latinx profession that is composed of community leaders is encouraging for communities of color and other minimized groups. This application and the partnerships formed within the local health care systems will serve as an opportunity for skilled individuals to collect the data that best shows their impact on community wellness. Detailed proof of value creation will allow them to gain the capital they need to scale up services and connect more people to care. This growing enterprise combines my interest in public health data collection, Black-led cooperatives, and diverse funding strategies. </p>
                <p>Outside of my venture, I want to help community-run non-profits harness the ability to measure social impact and present the return on investment that they uniquely provide. The systems-level changes that communities need require generational efforts of service provision, policy change, power redistribution, and, of course, funds. I am passionate about access to affordable, quality education; culturally competent healthcare that supports holistic flourishing; and the right to gainful employment for all individuals. These issues are complex, but I think that grant recipients can act as a network to address dynamic community needs. Leaders are doing great work in their communities, but their scale can be expanded with the right grant writing support and the best-aligned grant providers for their long-term goals.</p>
                <p>In the long-term, I plan to utilize the competencies I acquired through my professional roles and my LC101 program to research the relationship between wealth building and community health, in addition to promoting sustainable and collaborative change to end the cycle of inequity as it relates to resource attainment and community development.</p>
